### 🎯 High-Impact Proposals

**1. Proposal 060: Fused Post-Sigmoid Gating for Chunkwise Linear RNN Readout** (Priority: **high**)
- **Hypothesis**: Fusing a post-readout sigmoid gate into the chunkwise linear RNN kernel epilogue improves perplexity by 0.3–0.8 points with zero wall-clock overhead.
- **Why it matters**: This is the _lowest-hanging fruit_ in the entire proposal set. Post-sigmoid gating (from the NeurIPS 2025 Best Paper on softmax attention) breaks the low-rank bottleneck in V·Wₒ — and Experiment 009 (already implemented, awaiting results) is validating the core mechanism on MQAR. The key insight: linear attention/SSMs suffer _more_ from this bottleneck than softmax attention, so the improvement should be proportionally larger. Fusing into the epilogue means it's essentially free at inference.
- **Estimated cost**: <$2 for MVE (MQAR task), <$10 for small-scale language modeling ablation
- **Impact score**: 9/10 — Near-zero implementation risk, strong theoretical grounding, directly applicable to all GLA/KDA/mLSTM variants. The "free lunch" nature of epilogue fusion makes this an immediate win.

**2. Proposal 061: StableSSM Gradient-Balanced Decay Reparameterization for KDA/GLA** (Priority: **high**)
- **Hypothesis**: Replacing sigmoid decay gates with StableSSM's reparameterization $\alpha_t = 1 - 1/(a \cdot f(x_t)^2 + b)$ enables 2–5× higher learning rates without divergence.
- **Why it matters**: This is a _pure reparameterization_ — zero architectural change, zero inference cost, zero new parameters. StableSSM proved that standard sigmoid parameterization creates exponentially imbalanced gradients between fast-decay and slow-decay modes, which is exactly the failure mode seen in aggressive LR schedules for GLA/KDA. If it works, every existing linear RNN benefits immediately.
- **Estimated cost**: <$1 for MVE, <$8 for sweep across 3 decay parameterizations
- **Impact score**: 8/10 — Extremely cheap to validate, high upside if it unlocks faster training convergence, zero downside risk (worst case: no improvement, revert).

### 🧪 Experiment Updates

- **Experiment 002: SSD-DeltaNet WY Hybrid** (Status: ✅ completed)
  - **Key findings**: Mathematical correctness confirmed (error <1e-5), but PyTorch-level block decomposition is 16% _slower_ than naive — CUDA kernel launch overhead dominates at small block sizes. **Implication**: SSD-style speedups require fused CUDA/Triton kernels, not PyTorch primitives.
  - **Cost**: $0.10

- **Experiment 007: Oscillatory-Gated Selective SSM** (Status: ✅ completed, **PASS**)
  - **Key findings**: **93% accuracy** vs 47% for LTI baseline on selective copying. Input-dependent oscillatory parameters (ω(x), ζ(x)) enable selectivity while preserving stability-by-construction. Zero NaN events. This is the cleanest validation that oscillatory parameterization + selectivity is viable.
  - **Cost**: $0.00 (CPU only!)

- **Experiment 026: Cyclic Reduction vs Prefix Scan** (Status: ✅ completed, **PASS**)
  - **Key findings**: **3.88× speedup** at T=1024, n=32 on CPU. Cyclic reduction's O(Tn³) work advantage over prefix scan's O(Tn³ log T) translates to real wall-clock gains for dense (non-diagonal) SSM recurrences. GPU validation pending (code/026_scaled ready).
  - **Cost**: $0.00

- **Experiment 029: Circulant FAVOR+ Linear Attention** (Status: ✅ completed, **MIXED**)
  - **Key findings**: Circulant projection preserves FAVOR+ quality (validating the math), but FAVOR+ itself catastrophically fails on associative recall (23% vs ReLU linear attention's 98.5%). **Critical takeaway**: Don't build on FAVOR+ for recall-heavy tasks — simple ReLU feature maps dominate.
  - **Cost**: $0.10

- **Experiment 025: Nyström Landmark Compression** (Status: ✅ completed, **PASS**)
  - **Key findings**: 4× state compression achieves 99.25% accuracy (paradoxically _better_ than uncompressed 99.08%). Model co-adapts with compression as an implicit regularizer. Validates low-rank inter-chunk state transfer.
  - **Cost**: $0.05

- **Experiment 022: Displacement-Rank SSM** (Status: ✅ completed, **FAIL**)
  - **Key findings**: Cauchy-like matrices with displacement rank α provide no expressivity benefit on S5 — both α=1 and α=4 achieve identical accuracy, while dense SSM solves trivially. Ill-conditioned gradients from Cauchy structure prevent optimization. **Kill this direction.**
  - **Cost**: $0.00

- **Experiment 006: Monarch-Gated SSM** (Status: 🔄 ongoing, v2 running)
  - **Progress**: Fixed critical Cayley per-step overhead (800×/sample → batched), achieved 2.23× speedup. v1 overfitting solved by switching to online data generation. v2 running on Modal T4.
  - **Cost**: ~$0.30 so far

- **Experiments 012 (Expert-Choice Monarch) & 021 (HSS Telescopic Attention)**: Both **FAILED**. Expert-choice routing for SSM heads didn't produce the expected specialization. HSS compression was too expensive to validate at MVE scale.

### 📚 New Discoveries (254 tricks documented)

This is a _massive_ documentation sprint — 254 tricks spanning 8 categories. The most impactful clusters:

- **Stability techniques for low-precision training** (Tricks 221, 227, 234, 235, 236, 247): Kahan compensated summation, Smooth-SwiGLU, TWEO outlier prevention, Unit Scaling, FP8 precision decoupling, stochastic rounding. These form a complete toolkit for FP8/FP16 training stability — directly enabling Proposals 050 and 054.

- **Chunkwise linear RNN kernel machinery** (Tricks 158, 177, 182, 203, 211, 212, 217): TFLA two-level tiling, GLA secondary chunking, fused atomic state passing, Gated DeltaNet WY, KDA DPLR delta, FlashRNN fused recurrence, Lightning Attention-2. This is the _infrastructure layer_ — most high-impact proposals build on these.

- **Structured state transitions beyond diagonal** (Tricks 076, 055, 078, 111, 030, 194, 178): Monarch factorization, Group-and-Shuffle, Monomial matrices, Signed permutations, Column-sparse, ACDC cascaded diagonal-circulant, DeltaProduct multi-step Householder. Directly feeds the "expressivity vs efficiency" research arc.

- **Post-attention gating & readout improvements** (Tricks 094, 222, 243): Post-sigmoid gating, Higher-Order Linear Attention, Residual Linear Attention. These address the _output bottleneck_ of linear models — the most promising near-term quality improvement direction.

### Other Proposals (selected highlights from 62 total)

- **036: Near-Far Field Chunkwise GLA** — FMMformer-style banded+low-rank intra-chunk decomposition. Theoretically elegant, MVE ~$2, but requires custom kernel work. Medium priority.
- **044: MatMulScan Tensor-Core Inter-Chunk State Propagation** — Routes all scan ops through tensor cores via Brent-Kung style matmul scan. Requires H100 for validation. Medium-high priority if hardware available.
- **048: Segmented MatMulScan for Packed Variable-Length Training** — Addresses the real-world problem of variable-length sequence packing. High practical impact but requires custom CUDA. ~$5 MVE.
- **053: MLA-Inspired Latent State Compression for Linear RNN Inference** — Weight absorption for linear RNN KV-state. Elegant idea, 2–4× inference throughput if it works. ~$3 MVE.
- **059: Second-Order KDA with HLA Key Metric** — Data-adaptive removal directions for delta rule. Theoretically deep but expensive to validate properly (~$10 MVE).

### Strategic Insights

**Three converging themes demand immediate attention:**

1. **The output bottleneck is the cheapest win.** Experiments 007 and 009 confirm that gating/readout improvements transfer from softmax to linear attention. Proposals 060 and 061 are pure reparameterizations with zero inference cost — implement these _first_. Combined, they could yield 0.5–1.5 perplexity points for <$5 total validation cost.

2. **Structured transitions work but need fused kernels.** Experiment 002 proved that PyTorch-level restructuring is insufficient — real speedups require Triton/CUDA fusion. The Monarch-Gated SSM (Exp 006, running now) will tell us whether the _quality_ improvement justifies kernel engineering investment. Cyclic reduction (Exp 026) validated the algorithmic advantage; the GPU-scaled version should be prioritized.

3. **Kill the losers fast.** Displacement-rank SSMs (Exp 022), HSS linear attention (Exp 005), FAVOR+ feature maps (Exp 029), and Expert-Choice Monarch (Exp 012) all failed. The pattern: approaches requiring complex numerical infrastructure (Cauchy matrices, HSS trees, random feature maps) underperform simpler structured approaches (Monarch, circulant, plain ReLU) on the small-scale benchmarks that matter for <$10 validation. **Focus on the simple-but-effective quadrant.**

**Recommended next actions (in priority order):**
1. Run Proposal 061 MVE (StableSSM reparam, <$1) — pure upside, no risk
2. Run Proposal 060 MVE (fused sigmoid gating, <$2) — wait for Exp 009 results first
3. Check Experiment 006 v2 results (Monarch-Gated SSM) — pivotal for structured transitions arc
4. Run Experiment 026_scaled on GPU — validate cyclic reduction speedup on real hardware
5. Design MVE for Proposal 053 (MLA latent state compression) — high practical impact for inference
