### 🎯 High-Impact Proposals (Top Picks for <$10 Budget)

**1. Log-Semiring SSM (Proposal 014)** — Priority: **HIGH**
- **Hypothesis**: Replace standard $(+, \times)$ semiring in SSM scans with $(\text{logsumexp}, +)$ to natively compute softmax-weighted attention in $O(T)$ time.
- **Why it matters**: This is the most theoretically clean unification of softmax attention and SSMs proposed in this batch. If it works, it collapses the quality gap between linear attention and softmax — the central open problem in efficient sequence modeling. The MVE is already implemented (code/014) and the selective copying task directly tests the core claim.
- **Estimated cost**: MVE ~$0.40 (8 min on T4). Small-scale validation ~$16.
- **Impact score**: 9/10 — Cheapest MVE in the batch with highest theoretical upside. The logsumexp operator is numerically well-understood and the online-softmax trick (trick 083) directly applies.

**2. Cyclic Reduction for Dense SSM Recurrences (Proposal 026)** — Priority: **HIGH**
- **Hypothesis**: Cyclic reduction achieves $O(Tn^3)$ work vs prefix scan's $O(Tn^3 \log T)$ for non-diagonal SSM training.
- **Why it matters**: **Already validated on CPU** — Experiment 026 showed 3.88× speedup at T=1024 and 6× GEMM reduction. This is the rare proposal where the MVE *already succeeded* and the next step (GPU kernel validation at code/026_scaled) is ready to run. Enabling practical dense-transition SSMs (DeltaNet, DeltaProduct) to train 2-4× faster would be a significant infrastructure win.
- **Estimated cost**: GPU validation ~$5-8 (2 GPU-hours on A100).
- **Impact score**: 8.5/10 — Low risk (already proven on CPU), high practical value, clear next step.

**3. GS-Monomial SSM (Proposal 016)** — Priority: **HIGH**
- **Hypothesis**: Group-and-Shuffle monomial state transitions achieve dense-level expressivity at $O(n\sqrt{n})$ cost via block-diagonal monomial factors + shuffle permutation.
- **Why it matters**: Addresses the fundamental expressivity-efficiency gap. Monomial matrices are closed under multiplication (critical for parallel scan), and the GS factorization is proven to reach the full orthogonal group with just 2 factors. The MVE (code/016) is implemented and targets S5 composition — the canonical non-abelian benchmark.
- **Estimated cost**: MVE ~$0.50 (10 min T4).
- **Impact score**: 8/10 — Novel combination of GS factorization + monomial closure. Clear test (S5 composition). But requires careful Gumbel-Sinkhorn tuning.


### 🧪 Experiment Updates

**Experiment 026: Cyclic Reduction vs Prefix Scan** (Status: ✅ COMPLETED)
- **Proposal**: 026-cyclic-reduction-randmscan-ssm-recurrence
- **Key findings**: 3.88× wall-clock speedup (CPU), 6.01× GEMM savings at T=1024 with < 10⁻¹⁵ numerical error. CR's advantage grows with sequence length. **Ready for GPU validation** (code/026_scaled implemented).
- **Cost**: $0.00 (CPU-only)

**Experiment 007: OscGate-SSM** (Status: ✅ COMPLETED)
- **Proposal**: 007-oscillatory-gated-selective-ssm
- **Key findings**: **93% accuracy** on selective copying vs 47% for fixed-frequency LinOSS — a 46pp gap that definitively proves input-dependent oscillatory parameters enable selectivity. Stability guarantee held (0 NaN events). Only 1.8× overhead vs diagonal SSM.
- **Cost**: $0.00 (CPU-only)

**Experiment 011: Neumann-Approximate Resolvent** (Status: ✅ COMPLETED)
- **Proposal**: 011-neumann-resolvent-chunkwise-ssm
- **Key findings**: k=4 Neumann terms achieve < 10⁻⁴ relative error with 3.8-8.9× speedup scaling. Convergence guaranteed (spectral radius < 0.11). But near-resonance motivation was weak; value is pure speed at large state dims.
- **Cost**: $0.00 (CPU-only)

**Experiment 029: Circulant FAVOR+** (Status: ❌ ABANDONED)
- **Proposal**: 029-circulant-favor-plus-linear-attention
- **Key findings**: Circulant projection matches dense FAVOR+ quality (validates the optimization), but FAVOR+ itself fails catastrophically on associative recall (23% test vs 98.5% for simple ReLU linear attention). **Lesson: don't optimize a broken primitive.**
- **Cost**: ~$0.10

**Experiment 022: Displacement-Rank SSM** (Status: ❌ ABANDONED)
- **Proposal**: 022-displacement-rank-ssm-state-transitions
- **Key findings**: Cauchy-like structure creates ill-conditioned gradients that prevent learning. α=4 shows no benefit over α=1; both fail on harder S5 task (1-3% vs Dense's 97%). **Lesson: theoretical expressivity ≠ practical trainability.**
- **Cost**: $0.00 (CPU-only)

**Experiment 025: Nyström Landmark Compression** (Status: ✅ COMPLETED)
- **Proposal**: 025-nystrom-landmark-chunkwise-ssm
- **Key findings**: 4× state compression with Nyström (m=2) achieves **99.25% accuracy** vs 99.08% full — the model co-adapts around the compression bottleneck even when the low-rank assumption is violated. Validates the approach; needs scaling to n=32-128.
- **Cost**: ~$0.05

**Experiment 005: HSS Linear Attention** (Status: ❌ ABANDONED)
- **Proposal**: 005-segmented-hss-linear-attention
- **Key findings**: HSS tree structure is 6.3× slower than dense on GPU (sequential traversals). Neither HSS nor dense achieved >25% accuracy on the task. GPU-unfriendly exotic structures are dead ends.
- **Cost**: ~$0.15

**Experiments 010, 014, 015, 016, 017, 019, 028, 030, 031** (Status: 🔧 IMPLEMENTED, awaiting runs)
- All have code ready in their respective directories with configs and Modal deployment files. Many have had smoke tests pass. These represent the next batch to execute.

### Strategic Insights

**1. The semiring frontier is the most promising architectural direction.** Proposals 014 (log-semiring) and 015 (tropical) represent genuinely novel SSM architectures that could close the softmax quality gap — the #1 open problem in efficient sequence modeling. Both MVEs are implemented and cost <$1 to run. **Run these first.**

**2. Experiment results reveal a sharp divide: "correct math" vs "trainable systems."** Experiments 022 (Cauchy-like) and 005 (HSS) had beautiful theory but failed due to optimization barriers and GPU-unfriendliness. Meanwhile, the simplest approaches (Experiment 007's input-dependent gating, Experiment 025's Nyström co-adaptation) succeeded. **Favor approaches with clean gradient flow and GPU-friendly primitives (matmuls, FFTs).**

**3. The kernel optimization proposals are safe bets with guaranteed payoff.** Unlike architecture proposals (which may not train), kernel optimizations (032, 033, 038) can only succeed or provide useful profiling data. However, they require Triton/CUDA expertise and are higher-effort MVEs ($2-5 each). **Batch these as a second priority after architecture MVEs.**

**4. Recommended execution order for next $10 budget:**
   1. Run Experiment 014 (Log-Semiring SSM) — ~$0.40
   2. Run Experiment 015 (Tropical-Gated SSM) — ~$0.50
   3. Run Experiment 016 (GS-Monomial SSM) — ~$0.50
   4. Run Experiment 026_scaled (Cyclic Reduction GPU validation) — ~$5
   5. Run Experiments 017, 027, 028 (remaining orthogonal SSM variants) — ~$1.50
   
   Total: ~$8.40, testing 7 distinct architectural hypotheses.
