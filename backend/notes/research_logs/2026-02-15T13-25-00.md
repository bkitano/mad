### 🎯 High-Impact Proposals

**1. Post-Sigmoid Gating for Linear Attention / SSM Readout** (Proposal 009) — Priority: **HIGH**
- **Hypothesis**: Applying the NeurIPS 2025 Best Paper technique (post-attention sigmoid gating) to *linear attention and SSM readout* breaks the low-rank output bottleneck, yielding 5–15% perplexity improvement at <2% latency cost.
- **Why it matters**: This is the lowest-hanging fruit in the entire batch. It's a single elementwise sigmoid gate insertion — no new math, no new kernels, no custom CUDA. The theoretical rationale is strong: linear attention / SSMs suffer from a *more severe* information bottleneck than softmax attention (compressed state → readout), so the multiplicative nonlinearity should help *more* here than in the softmax case where it already won Best Paper. Dead simple to A/B test on any existing SSM codebase.
- **Estimated cost**: **<$2** — modify 5 lines in an existing Mamba/GLA training script, run on a small LM task (WikiText-103 or similar).
- **Impact score**: **9/10** — Near-zero implementation risk, strong theoretical backing, immediately applicable to production models. The only question is magnitude of improvement.

**2. Circulant SSM: Fourier-Domain Parallel Scan** (Proposal 013) — Priority: **HIGH**
- **Hypothesis**: Block-circulant state transitions, diagonalized via FFT, enable element-wise parallel scans in frequency space — recovering diagonal-SSM parallelism with dense-transition expressivity at O(n log n) per step.
- **Why it matters**: This is the most elegant solution to the diagonal-vs-dense SSM tradeoff seen so far. The key insight is that circulant matrices are *simultaneously* dense (full coordinate mixing) and diagonalizable (O(n log n) via FFT), and this diagonalization commutes perfectly with parallel scan. Unlike DeltaProduct (sequential Householder products) or Monarch SSMs (multi-factor products), circulant transitions compose cleanly in the Fourier domain: `FFT(C₁ · C₂) = FFT(C₁) ⊙ FFT(C₂)`. This means the scan operator is just elementwise complex multiply — identical cost to diagonal SSMs.
- **Estimated cost**: **<$5** — implement circulant transition layer, test on MQAR + S5 permutation composition benchmarks.
- **Impact score**: **8.5/10** — Could be a genuine architectural breakthrough. Risk: circulant matrices may be too structured (they're normal matrices, so no non-normal dynamics). Reward: if it works on S5, it's strictly better than diagonal SSMs at negligible extra cost.


### 🧪 Experiment Updates

- **Experiment 007: OscGate-SSM** (Status: ✅ **COMPLETED — PROCEED**)
  - **Proposal**: 007 — Oscillatory-Gated Selective SSM
  - **Key finding**: **Core hypothesis validated.** OscGate-SSM achieves 93.0% on selective copying (vs. LinOSS 46.8%), proving that input-dependent oscillatory parameters enable selectivity while preserving stability-by-construction. 46.2pp gap is decisive. Speed overhead only 1.8× vs diagonal SSM.
  - **Cost**: $0.00 (CPU only, ~25 min)
  - **Next**: Scale to language modeling. The stability guarantee + selectivity combination is novel and valuable.

- **Experiment 026: Cyclic Reduction vs Prefix Scan** (Status: ✅ **COMPLETED — PROCEED**)
  - **Proposal**: 026 — Cyclic Reduction for Dense SSM Recurrences
  - **Key finding**: **3.88× CPU speedup at T=1024, 6.01× GEMM reduction.** Numerical accuracy at machine epsilon. Speedup grows monotonically with sequence length. This is a pure algorithmic win — fewer matrix multiplies, same answer.
  - **Cost**: $0.00 (CPU only, ~3 min)
  - **Next**: GPU validation (Experiment 026_scaled planned, est. $18–24). The CPU results strongly suggest GPU speedups will hold, but need to verify tensor-core utilization patterns.

- **Experiment 022: Displacement-Rank SSM** (Status: ❌ **COMPLETED — ABANDON**)
  - **Proposal**: 022 — Displacement-Rank SSM State Transitions
  - **Key finding**: **Cauchy-like matrices are a dead end for SSM transitions.** α=4 doesn't outperform α=1 (both 95.8%), Cauchy matvec throughput only 0.20× dense (target was >0.3×), and the 1/(sᵢ - sⱼ) terms create ill-conditioned gradients. Dense matrices win at α=16 (97.4%) with simpler code.
  - **Cost**: $0.00 (CPU only, ~15 min)
  - **Lesson learned**: Displacement rank theory is elegant but the Cauchy parameterization introduces optimization barriers that negate the structural efficiency gains.

- **Experiment 004: Oscillatory-DPLR SSM** (Status: 🐛 **COMPLETED — DEBUG**)
  - **Proposal**: 004 — Oscillatory-DPLR SSM
  - **Key finding**: Complete training failure (loss stuck at 0.854). Parameterization is correct (learned ω in valid range), but model can't fit training data. Suspected forward-pass bug in complex dtype handling.
  - **Cost**: $0.00 (CPU only, ~27 min)

- **Experiment 015: Tropical-Gated SSM** (Status: 🔧 **IMPLEMENTED** — awaiting run)
- **Experiment 020: OH-DeltaProduct** (Status: 🔧 **IMPLEMENTED** — awaiting run)
- **Experiment 026_scaled: Cyclic Reduction GPU** (Status: 🔧 **IMPLEMENTED** — awaiting run, est. $18–24)


### 📚 New Discoveries (162 tricks documented)

A massive documentation sprint covering the full stack from algebraic foundations to GPU kernel optimization. Key clusters:

- **Circulant/Toeplitz machinery** (Tricks 004, 013, 016, 018, 024, 028, 029, 032, 038, 067, 079, 084, 100, 119, 129): Complete toolkit for FFT-based structured matrix layers. The Toeplitz→Circulant embedding (129) and CSCS splitting (032) are particularly actionable — they turn any Toeplitz-structured computation into O(n log n) FFT operations.

- **HSS/hierarchical matrix framework** (Tricks 001, 008, 043, 052, 054, 059, 060, 063, 088, 097, 098, 102, 122, 123, 127, 131, 138, 146): An industrial-strength library of hierarchical matrix algorithms. The black-box HSS compression (008) is the gateway drug — it needs only matrix-vector products, no matrix entries.

- **Permutation learning & N:M sparsity** (Tricks 003, 006, 007, 017, 058, 070, 071, 085, 087, 089, 110, 114, 115, 120, 130, 133, 136, 140, plus nmSPARSE, MaskLLM): Comprehensive coverage of the sparsity-permutation co-design space. The V:N:M hierarchical sparsity (140) enabling >50% structured sparsity with Sparse Tensor Core acceleration is the standout for practical deployment.

- **GPU kernel optimization** (Tricks 011, 025, 033, 039, 046, 047, 049, 050, 051, 061, 068, 075, 091, 093, 103, 104, 121, 126, 135, 141): Deep coverage of kernel fusion techniques. The warp-specialized pipelining (141, from FlashAttention-3) and EVT fusion (039) are the most immediately useful for building fast SSM implementations.

- **Semiring generalization** (Tricks 108, 113, 132): The theoretical foundation for tropical and log-semiring SSMs. SIMD² (113) is notable — it shows that 8 additional semiring operations can be hardware-accelerated with only 5% chip area overhead, making non-standard semiring SSMs a realistic hardware target.

### Strategic Insights

**The most important result today is negative**: Experiment 022 definitively kills the displacement-rank / Cauchy-like SSM direction. The ill-conditioned gradients from 1/(sᵢ - sⱼ) terms are a fundamental barrier, not a tuning problem. This redirects attention toward **circulant** (Proposal 013) and **Monarch** (Proposal 006) factorizations as the winning structured alternatives to diagonal SSMs — both avoid the Cauchy pitfall while achieving similar expressivity goals.

**The biggest opportunity is Proposal 009 (post-sigmoid gating)**: It requires almost zero implementation effort and targets a known bottleneck (linear attention's output information bottleneck). If it delivers even 5% perplexity improvement, it's immediately publishable and deployable. **Run this first.**

**Emerging theme — "circulant everything"**: With 15+ circulant tricks now documented, a coherent architecture is crystallizing: circulant state transitions (Proposal 013), circulant FAVOR+ projections (Proposal 029), circulant fine-tuning adapters (CDVFT, Trick 024), and circulant-diagonal flows (CDFlow, Trick 023). The FFT-native computational model means all these components compose cleanly. Consider a unified "CirSSM" architecture that uses circulant structure end-to-end.

**Immediate action items** (total budget ~$15):
1. **Run Proposal 009** (post-sigmoid gating, ~$2) — highest expected value per dollar
2. **Run Experiment 015** (Tropical SSM, already implemented, ~$1)
3. **Run Experiment 020** (OH-DeltaProduct, already implemented, ~$1)
4. **Implement & run Proposal 013** (Circulant SSM, ~$5) — the most promising new architecture
5. **Debug Experiment 004** (Osc-DPLR, $0) — likely a simple complex-dtype bug
