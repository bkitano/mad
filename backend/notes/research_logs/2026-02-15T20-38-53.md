I need to analyze this massive activity dump — 209 tricks, 32 proposals, and 27 experiments — and produce a focused, actionable log. Let me start by reading the most promising proposals and completed experiments in detail.

Let me also read the remaining proposals to understand the full landscape while waiting for the background agents.

Let me check on the progress of the experiment results agent while the others continue.Good, I'm getting substantial data from the experiment results. Let me now wait for the remaining agents to complete.I now have extensive data from all three agents. Let me also check if there's an experiment log file that might give me the overall picture.Now I have enough data. Let me now write the comprehensive log entry.Now I have the full picture. Let me write the log entry.Here's the research update log for the last 12 hours:

## Summary

The log has been written to `experiments/update-log-2026-02-15.md`. Here are the headlines:

### 🎯 Top 2 Proposals to Prioritize

1. **Circulant-Diagonal SSM State Transitions (023)** — Impact: 9/10, Cost: <$1
   - $O(n \log n)$ state transitions via FFT-diagonalized circulant-diagonal products
   - Cleanest path from diagonal (inexpressive) to dense (expensive) SSMs
   - Scan-compatible because composition stays in Fourier domain

2. **Cayley-Circulant Orthogonal SSM (027)** — Impact: 8.5/10, Cost: <$1
   - Exact orthogonality by construction + circulant efficiency
   - Already implemented as Experiment 027 — just needs to be run

### 🧪 Experiment Scorecard (9 completed)
- **5 clear passes**: SSD-DeltaNet (002), OscGate-SSM (007), Neumann Resolvent (011), Nyström Compression (025), Cyclic Reduction (026)
- **1 partial**: Displacement-Rank SSM (022) — likely implementation bug
- **1 informative pass**: Circulant FAVOR+ (029) — showed feature maps, not projection structure, are the bottleneck
- **1 failure**: Oscillatory-DPLR (004) — implementation bug, not architectural
- **Total spend: ~$0.40** across all experiments

### 💡 Key Strategic Insights

1. **Run the already-implemented experiments next** — Exps 027, 030, 013 directly test structured state transitions and are ready to go
2. **Kernel optimization proposals (16 of them) are premature** — first find which structured transition wins, then optimize
3. **MLA Latent State Compression (053) is the sleeper hit** — proven technique (DeepSeek-V2 weight absorption) applied to linear RNN inference for the first time
4. **Recommended next $5 spend**: Run 5 pending experiments + implement 2 new MVEs for Proposals 023 and 053
