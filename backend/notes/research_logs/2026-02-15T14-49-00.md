### 🎯 High-Impact Proposals

**1. Post-Sigmoid Gating for Linear Attention / SSM Readout** (Proposal 009) — Priority: **HIGH**
- **Hypothesis**: Applying the NeurIPS 2025 Best Paper technique (head-specific sigmoid gate after attention readout) to linear attention and SSMs will break the low-rank bottleneck in $W_V W_O$, improving quality 5–15% with <2% latency overhead.
- **Why it matters**: This is the *lowest-hanging fruit* in the entire batch. It's a ~5-line code change (add `output *= sigmoid(xW_g)` after readout), requires zero architectural redesign, and targets a known fundamental weakness of linear attention — the information bottleneck from compressing history into a fixed $d \times d$ state. The hypothesis is well-grounded: the original paper showed gains on softmax attention, and the bottleneck is *worse* for linear attention, suggesting even larger gains. The MVE cleanly isolates the effect (gated vs. ungated cosFormer on MQAR).
- **Estimated cost**: **<$1** (MVE: ~10 min single GPU)
- **Impact score**: **9/10** — Trivial to implement, near-zero risk, directly addresses a known bottleneck. Even if the gain is modest (5% vs. 15%), the cost of finding out is negligible.

**2. Circulant SSM: Fourier-Domain Parallel Scan** (Proposal 013) — Priority: **HIGH**
- **Hypothesis**: Circulant state transitions, diagonalized via FFT, enable element-wise parallel scans in frequency space — recovering $O(\log T)$ parallel depth of diagonal SSMs with full coordinate mixing at $O(n \log n)$ per step.
- **Why it matters**: This hits the sweet spot of the diagonal vs. dense SSM tradeoff. Unlike Monarch ($O(n\sqrt{n})$) or DeltaProduct ($O(n^2)$), circulant transitions are *exactly* diagonalizable, meaning the parallel scan reduces to the same element-wise form as diagonal SSMs — just in the Fourier domain. The MVE already has an implementation (Experiment 013, status: implemented). The critical limitation — commutativity means it cannot represent non-abelian groups — is acknowledged but acceptable for many practical tasks. At $0.25 MVE cost, this is a cheap test of whether circulant coordinate mixing adds meaningful value over diagonal.
- **Estimated cost**: **<$1** (MVE: ~5 min single GPU)
- **Impact score**: **8/10** — Elegant theory, cheap to validate, but commutativity caps its ceiling. If it works on Z_8 but fails on S_5, the *negative result itself* is informative: it proves coordinate mixing alone isn't enough, non-commutativity is the key.


### 🧪 Experiment Updates

- **Experiment 007: OscGate-SSM** (Status: **completed — PROCEED**)
  - **Proposal**: 007-oscillatory-gated-selective-ssm
  - **Progress**: Full MVE on selective copying. Three models trained: OscGate-SSM, LinOSS (LTI), DiagonalSSM.
  - **Key findings**: OscGate-SSM achieved **93.0%** accuracy, validating that input-dependent oscillatory parameters enable selectivity. LinOSS (fixed parameters) achieved only **46.8%** — a 46pp gap proving selectivity is essential. However, **DiagonalSSM matched at 94.8%**, suggesting the oscillatory inductive bias doesn't provide additional benefit on this task. Zero NaN/Inf events validates stability-by-construction. The oscillatory structure adds 1.8× overhead for no quality gain on selective copying.
  - **Cost**: ~$0.00 (CPU only)
  - **⚠️ Implication**: The oscillatory parameterization's value proposition needs a *different* task to justify itself — one where long-range periodic memory matters (e.g., periodic signal detection, music modeling). On pure state-tracking tasks, simpler diagonal gating wins.

- **Experiment 022: Displacement-Rank SSM (DR-SSM)** (Status: **completed — ABANDON**)
  - **Proposal**: 022-displacement-rank-ssm-state-transitions
  - **Progress**: Tested α ∈ {0, 1, 2, 4, 16} on S5 permutation composition.
  - **Key findings**: α=1 already reached **95.8%** accuracy, invalidating the hypothesis that higher displacement rank systematically improves expressivity. At longer sequences (seq_len=20), *all* Cauchy-structured models catastrophically failed while dense SSM solved it at 97.2%. The $1/(s_i - s_j)$ Cauchy kernel creates **pathological gradient flow**. Cauchy matvec is 4.9× slower than dense at n=16. **Verdict: Displacement rank is theoretically elegant but practically broken.**
  - **Cost**: ~$0.00 (CPU only)

- **Experiment 026: Cyclic Reduction vs Prefix Scan** (Status: **completed — PROCEED**)
  - **Proposal**: 026-cyclic-reduction-randmscan-ssm-recurrence
  - **Progress**: CPU benchmark of cyclic reduction vs. prefix scan for dense SSM recurrences.
  - **Key findings**: **3.88× speedup** over prefix scan at T=1024, n=32 after vectorizing back-substitution. GEMM count ratio of 6.01× (near theoretical max of 6.67×). Machine-precision numerical accuracy. All operations are batched GEMMs — ideal for tensor cores. A scaled GPU experiment (026_scaled) is implemented and ready for validation.
  - **Cost**: ~$0.00 (CPU only)

- **Experiment 004: Oscillatory-DPLR SSM** (Status: **completed — DEBUG**)
  - **Proposal**: 004-oscillatory-dplr-ssm
  - **Key findings**: Model failed to learn (training loss flat at ~0.854 across 50 epochs). Learned parameters are in sensible ranges (ω ∈ [0.012, 0.096], ζ ∈ [0.26, 0.71]), suggesting a forward computation bug rather than fundamental limitation.

- **Experiments 013, 014, 015, 017, 019, 020, 021, 027, 028, 031** (Status: **implemented**, awaiting runs)
  - A large batch of MVEs are coded and ready. Most promising to run next: **013** (circulant SSM on Z_8), **017** (hyperoctahedral signed-perm SSM on B_3), **028** (Neumann-Cayley orthogonal SSM on S5).


### 📚 New Discoveries

165 tricks were documented — a massive cataloging effort. Key thematic clusters:

- **Circulant & structured matrix decompositions** (028, 032, 084, 129, 024, 023, 100, 038, 079, 067): A comprehensive library of circulant, Toeplitz, and block-circulant techniques. The **Toeplitz-to-Circulant Embedding** (129) and **CSCS splitting** (032) are foundational for anyone building circulant SSMs. The **CDFlow** (023) and **CDVFT** (024) tricks show circulant-diagonal products are already being used for PEFT and normalizing flows.

- **HSS/hierarchical matrix algorithms** (001, 008, 052, 054, 059, 063, 088, 097, 098, 122, 123, 127, 131, 138, 146): A deep dive into hierarchically semiseparable matrices. The **black-box randomized HSS compression** (008) and **quasi-optimal greedy HSS approximation** (097) are directly applicable to Proposal 021 (HSS-compressed attention).

- **GPU kernel optimization** (033, 039, 046, 047, 049, 050, 051, 061, 075, 091, 103, 121, 126, 135, 141, 158): The kernel tricks form a toolkit for implementing the algebraic ideas efficiently. **Warp-specialized pipelining** (141), **Stream-K** (121), and **BRGEMM** (batch-reduce GEMM) are critical building blocks for custom SSM kernels. **TFLA** (158) shows two-level tiled chunkwise parallelism already achieves significant speedups for linear RNNs.

- **N:M structured sparsity** (130, 133, 136, 140, and nmSPARSE): The transposable N:M mask techniques (130, 133/TSENOR) are key enablers for Proposals 024, 031, and 035 — training sparse SSMs from scratch with hardware acceleration on both forward and backward passes.

- **Semiring generalizations** (108, 113, 132): The **semiring monoid lifting** (108) and **tropical attention** (132) directly motivate Proposals 014 and 015 (log-semiring and tropical SSMs).

- **Permutation learning** (003, 006, 007, 085, 087, 110, 114, 115, 120): A rich set of tools for differentiable permutation optimization — **Sinkhorn** (115), **Gumbel-Softmax** (057), **OT4P** (085), **ShuffleSoftSort** (110), **auction algorithm** (003). These are prerequisites for proposals involving learned channel permutations (016, 024, 030).

- **EVT-Fused SSM Epilogues** (033): Requires CUTLASS EVT integration, harder to prototype.
- **Circulant FAVOR+** (029): Interesting but incremental over existing random feature methods.
- **Group-Matrix Displacement SSM** (030): Theoretically rich but high complexity.


### Strategic Insights

**1. The expressivity-efficiency frontier is the central battle.** The completed experiments paint a clear picture: diagonal SSMs are too weak (fail on S5 composition), dense SSMs are too expensive, and the Cauchy-structured middle ground (DR-SSM) is broken in practice. The winning zone is **structured non-diagonal transitions** — circulant, Monarch, GS-monomial, or Householder products — that preserve parallel scan compatibility. Proposals 006, 013, 016, and 027 each attack this from different angles. **Run the implemented MVEs for 013 (circulant/Z_8) and 017 (hyperoctahedral/B_3) immediately — they're the cheapest experiments that directly test different points on this frontier.**

**2. Post-readout gating (Proposal 009) is the single highest-ROI experiment.** It costs essentially nothing, requires minimal code, and targets a *proven* technique (NeurIPS 2025 Best Paper) applied to a *known bottleneck* (linear attention's information compression). If it works, it's immediately deployable in any GLA/Mamba variant. **This should be the very first thing to run.**

**3. The experiment pipeline is producing actionable negative results.** The DR-SSM abandonment (Cauchy gradient pathology) and OscGate-SSM's parity with diagonal SSM on selective copying are both valuable. They redirect effort: skip Cauchy-like parameterizations, and test oscillatory models on *periodic* rather than *selective* tasks. The 3.88× cyclic reduction speedup is a strong positive signal — the GPU validation (026_scaled) should be run to confirm real-world gains.

**Recommended execution order** (all under $10 total):
1. **009** (post-sigmoid gating) — highest ROI, ~$0.50
2. **013** (circulant SSM on Z_8) — already implemented, ~$0.25
3. **014** (log-semiring SSM) — already implemented, ~$0.25
4. **017** (hyperoctahedral SSM) — already implemented, ~$0.25
5. **028** (Neumann-Cayley SSM on S5) — already implemented, ~$0.50
6. **027** (Cayley-circulant SSM on delayed copy) — already implemented, ~$0.25
7. **026_scaled** (cyclic reduction GPU validation) — confirm the 3.88× result on GPU

Total estimated cost: **~$2.25** for 7 experiments covering the full expressivity-efficiency frontier.
