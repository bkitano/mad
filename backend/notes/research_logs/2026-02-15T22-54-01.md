I need to analyze a massive amount of activity - 241 tricks, 60 proposals, and 24 experiments. Let me process this systematically.Read the following experiment results files and summarize the key findings from each (status, what worked, what failed, cost, key metrics):

1. /home/bkitano/Desktop/vault/projects/mad-architecture-search/code/002 - look for results files (002_results.md or similar)
2. /home/bkitano/Desktop/vault/projects/mad-architecture-search/code/004 - results
3. /home/bkitano/Desktop/vault/projects/mad-architecture-search/code/005 - results
4. /home/bkitano/Desktop/vault/projects/mad-architecture-search/code/007 - results

### 🎯 High-Impact Proposals

**1. Proposal 060: Fused Post-Sigmoid Gating for Chunkwise Linear RNN Readout** (Priority: **high**)
- **Hypothesis**: Fusing a post-readout sigmoid gate into chunkwise linear RNN kernels (GLA, KDA, mLSTM) as an epilogue yields 0.3–0.8 perplexity improvement with zero additional HBM traffic.
- **Why it matters**: Experiment 009 (post-sigmoid gating for linear attention, currently implemented) already validates the core idea that sigmoid gating breaks the low-rank bottleneck in linear readout. Experiment 007 proved input-dependent gating is the key differentiator (93% vs 47%). This proposal takes a **proven trick** and eliminates its overhead via kernel fusion — it's optimization of a known-good idea, not speculative. The EVT epilogue fusion is well-understood from trick 039.
- **Estimated cost**: <$5 (small model ablation on T4/L4)
- **Impact score**: 8/10 — Low risk (proven mechanism), high reward (quality + speed), cheap to validate. The main question is just kernel engineering.

**2. Proposal 045: DCT Frequency-Domain Kernel Feature Maps for Chunkwise GLA** (Priority: **high**)
- **Hypothesis**: Replacing GLA's identity feature map with DiJiang's deterministic DCT-based weighted kernel achieves 3–8% perplexity improvement at <3% throughput overhead.
- **Why it matters**: Experiment 029 (Circulant FAVOR+) revealed that random-projection-based feature maps (FAVOR+) fundamentally fail on associative recall — but the failure was in the random features, not the linear attention framework. DCT kernelization is **deterministic** (no variance), uses energy-compaction (DCT's strength), and is $O(d \log d)$. This directly addresses the lesson from 029: replace broken random features with structured deterministic ones.
- **Estimated cost**: <$5 (language model perplexity eval at 125M scale)
- **Impact score**: 8/10 — Addresses a known failure mode with a principled fix. If DCT feature maps close the softmax quality gap within GLA's chunkwise framework, this is a major practical win.

**3. Proposal 057: FlashRNN-Style Fused Inter-Chunk State Recurrence** (Priority: **high**)
- **Hypothesis**: Caching per-chunk transition matrices in registers and running the sequential state scan without HBM round-trips yields 1.2–1.5× speedup for the inter-chunk propagation bottleneck.
- **Why it matters**: Experiment 026 proved cyclic reduction achieves 3.88× CPU speedup for dense recurrences. This proposal is the natural GPU follow-up: instead of algorithmic tricks, use FlashRNN's proven register-caching approach for the inter-chunk sequential scan. The inter-chunk scan is the remaining sequential bottleneck in all chunkwise methods.
- **Estimated cost**: <$5 (kernel microbenchmark on H100)
- **Impact score**: 7/10 — Pure systems engineering with well-understood upside, but requires CUDA expertise.

### 🧪 Experiment Updates

**Completed This Window (8 experiments, ~$0.40 total):**

- **Experiment 002: SSD-DeltaNet Block Decomposition** (Status: **completed → ABANDON**)
  - **Proposal**: 002-ssd-deltanet-wy-hybrid
  - **Key finding**: Block decomposition is mathematically correct (error < 1e-5) but **0.84× speed** (16% slower) due to Python-level kernel launch overhead and small matmuls that underutilize tensor cores.
  - **Lesson**: Clean algebraic decomposition ≠ implementation speedup without fused kernels.
  - **Cost**: ~$0.10

- **Experiment 004: Oscillatory-DPLR SSM** (Status: **completed → DEBUG**)
  - **Proposal**: 004-oscillatory-dplr-ssm
  - **Key finding**: Forward pass bug — training MSE stuck at 8.5e-1 (target <1e-3). Parameterization is valid (ω, ζ in correct ranges) but model can't fit even synthetic damped oscillations.
  - **Cost**: $0.00 (CPU only)

- **Experiment 005: Segmented-HSS Linear Attention** (Status: **completed → ABANDON**)
  - **Proposal**: 005-segmented-hss-linear-attention
  - **Key finding**: HSS is GPU-hostile. 6.3× slower, 0.656× memory ratio (failed <0.2× target). Recursive tree traversals kill GPU parallelism.
  - **Cost**: ~$0.15

- **Experiment 007: OscGate-SSM** (Status: **completed → PROCEED**)
  - **Proposal**: 007-oscillatory-gated-selective-ssm
  - **Key finding**: ✅ **Core hypothesis validated**. 93% accuracy on selective copying vs 47% for non-selective LinOSS (46pp gap). Input-dependent oscillatory parameters enable content-aware gating while maintaining stability by construction.
  - **Cost**: $0.00 (CPU only)

- **Experiment 011: Neumann Resolvent** (Status: **completed → PROCEED**)
  - **Proposal**: 011-neumann-resolvent-chunkwise-ssm
  - **Key finding**: ✅ k=4 Neumann matches exact Woodbury to <1e-4 error. **8.9× speedup at N=256**. BF16 stable. But primary near-resonance motivation doesn't materialize with HiPPO init.
  - **Cost**: $0.00 (CPU only)

- **Experiment 022: Displacement-Rank SSM** (Status: **completed → ABANDON**)
  - **Proposal**: 022-displacement-rank-ssm-state-transitions
  - **Key finding**: α=1 and α=4 both hit 95.8% — no rank-scaling signal. Cauchy kernels create ill-conditioned gradients. Dense is faster AND more accurate.
  - **Cost**: $0.00 (CPU only)

- **Experiment 025: Nyström Compression** (Status: **completed → PROCEED**)
  - **Proposal**: 025-nystrom-landmark-chunkwise-ssm
  - **Key finding**: ✅ **4× compression preserves 99.25% accuracy**. Model co-adapts with compression — approximation error is high (0.86) but accuracy is maintained. Validates "learned compression" over "exact compression."
  - **Cost**: ~$0.05

- **Experiment 026: Cyclic Reduction** (Status: **completed → PROCEED**)
  - **Proposal**: 026-cyclic-reduction-randmscan-ssm-recurrence
  - **Key finding**: ✅ **3.88× CPU speedup** at T=1024, 6.01× GEMM reduction. Both methods match sequential to ~1e-15. Ready for GPU kernel implementation.
  - **Cost**: $0.00 (CPU only)

- **Experiment 029: Circulant FAVOR+** (Status: **completed → ABANDON**)
  - **Proposal**: 029-circulant-favor-plus-linear-attention
  - **Key finding**: Circulant projection matches dense FAVOR+ — but FAVOR+ itself fails catastrophically on associative recall (23.8% vs ReLU linear attention at 98.5%). The foundation is broken.
  - **Cost**: ~$0.10

**Currently Running:**

- **Experiment 006: Monarch-Gated State Transition SSM** (Status: **running on Modal**)
  - **Proposal**: 006-monarch-gated-state-transition
  - **Progress**: Deployed to T4, smoke tests passed, training S5 permutation composition. Results pending.
  - **Estimated cost**: <$0.50

- **Experiments 010, 012, 013, 014, 015, 016, 017, 019, 020, 027, 028, 030, 031**: All **implemented**, various stages of execution.

- **Experiment 012: Expert-Choice Monarch SSM** (Status: **FAILED**)

### Strategic Insights

**Three clear themes emerge from this 12-hour sprint:**

1. **"Proven mechanism + kernel fusion" beats "novel algebra."** The experiments show a stark pattern: mathematically elegant proposals (HSS attention, displacement rank, FAVOR+ circulant) fail in practice, while simple ideas with good implementations succeed (Nyström co-adaptation, cyclic reduction, oscillatory gating). The highest-impact next proposals are those that take *already-validated* mechanisms (sigmoid gating from Exp 007/009, Nyström compression from Exp 025, cyclic reduction from Exp 026) and fuse them into efficient kernels.

2. **The linear RNN kernel stack is mature enough for systematic optimization.** With 12+ new chunkwise kernel tricks documented (TFLA, GLA, FlashRNN, Lightning-2), the infrastructure knowledge exists to build deeply fused linear RNN layers. Proposals 057 (FlashRNN inter-chunk), 060 (fused sigmoid gating), and 032 (Chimera GEMM-chain fusion) target exactly this opportunity.

3. **Feature map quality is the binding constraint for linear attention.** Experiment 029 definitively showed that FAVOR+ random features are the bottleneck, not the linear attention framework itself. The DCT-based alternatives (DiJiang, trick #168) and cosFormer (#031) offer deterministic, structured replacements. Proposal 045 (DCT kernels for GLA) is the most direct path to closing the softmax quality gap in linear RNNs.

**Recommended focus for next $10 budget:** Run Experiment 006 (Monarch SSM, pending results), then prioritize Proposals 060 → 045 → 057 in that order. Each can be validated for <$3 on a single T4/L4 GPU.
