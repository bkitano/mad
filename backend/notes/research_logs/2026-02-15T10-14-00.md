### 🎯 High-Impact Proposals

**1. Post-Sigmoid Gating for Linear Attention & SSM Readout** (Proposal 009) — Priority: **HIGH**
- **Hypothesis**: Applying an input-dependent sigmoid gate to the readout path of linear attention/SSMs breaks the low-rank bottleneck at negligible cost.
- **Why it matters**: This is the single most "bang-for-buck" idea in the batch. It's orthogonal to every other proposal — a 2-line code change (linear projection + sigmoid + elementwise multiply) that can compose with any SSM or linear attention variant. The argument is well-grounded: Qiu et al. (NeurIPS 2025 Best Paper) showed this works for softmax attention, and the theoretical case for *larger* gains in linear attention is compelling — the readout bottleneck is strictly worse when there's no softmax nonlinearity. Nobody has tried this transfer.
- **Estimated cost**: MVE **~$0.50** (10 min single GPU); full validation ~$32
- **Impact score**: **9/10** — Trivial to implement, near-zero risk of wasted effort, composable with everything, and targets a bottleneck nobody else is addressing. If it fails, you learn something important about where the bottleneck actually is.

**2. Circulant SSM: Fourier-Domain Parallel Scan** (Proposal 013) — Priority: **HIGH**
- **Hypothesis**: Circulant state transitions become diagonal in Fourier domain, enabling element-wise parallel scans with full coordinate mixing at O(n log n) cost.
- **Why it matters**: This is the most *elegant* proposal — it resolves the core SSM design tension (diagonal=fast but no mixing vs. dense=expressive but slow) with a clean mathematical trick. The FFT diagonalization of circulant matrices is textbook, but nobody has applied it to input-dependent SSM state transitions with parallel scan. The result: Mamba-like parallel scan depth O(log T) with full coordinate mixing, at only a log(n) overhead. The cyclic group composition task is a perfect first test — circulant structure is literally the algebra of cyclic convolutions.
- **Estimated cost**: MVE **~$0.25** (5 min single GPU); full validation ~$8
- **Impact score**: **8.5/10** — Cheapest MVE of any proposal, mathematically principled, and tests on the most favorable task first. The key risk is the commutativity limitation (circulant matrices commute, limiting non-cyclic state tracking), but this is known upfront and block-circulant variants are a ready follow-up.

### 🧪 Experiment Updates

- **Experiment 002: Oscillatory-DPLR SSM** (Status: **DEBUG** ❌)
  - **Proposal**: 004-oscillatory-dplr-ssm
  - **Progress**: Implemented tiny model (129 params, 1 layer). The parameterization is correct — learned ω and ζ values land in the right physical range. But the model cannot learn at all: flat loss curve at MSE ~0.85 across 50 epochs.
  - **Key findings**: Implementation bug suspected (complex dtype handling, discretization, or gradient flow). The oscillatory parameterization concept isn't invalidated, but the forward pass needs debugging before scaling. **Cost: $0.00** (CPU-only, 27 min).
  - **Action**: Fix implementation before revisiting. Don't scale up.

- **Experiment 003: OscGate-SSM** (Status: **PROCEED** ✅)
  - **Proposal**: 007-oscillatory-gated-selective-ssm
  - **Progress**: Three models tested on selective copying (8 tokens, 8 queries, vocab=16). Required 3 attempts with architecture scaling (d=128, 2 layers, MLP head) to achieve success.
  - **Key findings**: **Core hypothesis validated.** OscGate-SSM achieves **93.0% accuracy** (target >90%) while LinOSS (LTI baseline) gets only **46.8%** — a 46pp gap proving input-dependent oscillatory parameters enable selectivity. The stability guarantee held perfectly (0 NaN/Inf). Competitive with unconstrained diagonal SSM (94.8%). Speed: 1.8x overhead (acceptable). **Cost: $0.00** (CPU-only, 25 min).
  - **Caveat**: LinOSS scored 46.8% vs target <40% — slightly higher than expected, but the directional evidence is overwhelming.

- **Experiment 004: Displacement-Rank SSM** (Status: **ABANDONED** ❌)
  - **Proposal**: 022-displacement-rank-ssm-state-transitions
  - **Progress**: Tested α ∈ {0,1,2,4,16} on S5 permutation composition. At seq_len=12 (easy), α=1 and α=4 both hit 95.8% — tied, failing the monotonic rank-scaling hypothesis. At seq_len=20 (hard), **all Cauchy models collapse** (1-7% accuracy) while dense SSM achieves 97.2%.
  - **Key findings**: **Displacement rank framework is fundamentally flawed for SSM state transitions.** The Cauchy kernel structure 1/(s_i - s_j) creates ill-conditioned gradients and optimization barriers. Theoretical expressivity does not translate to learnability. Dense works; Cauchy does not. **Cost: $0.00** (CPU-only, 15 min).
  - **Lesson learned**: Structured matrix parameterizations must be validated for *optimization properties*, not just theoretical capacity. This should inform evaluation of other structured transition proposals.

- **Experiment 001**: Status: **implemented** (no results yet)

### 📚 New Discoveries (128 tricks documented)

The 128 new tricks span 6 categories. Key highlights by theme:

- **Structured Matrix Zoo** (circulant, HSS, semiseparable): Massive documentation of circulant variants (block-circulant, g-circulant, DCT-DST circulant, CSCS splitting, α-circulant), HSS hierarchies (compression, ULV solver, SuperDC eigensolver, telescopic decomposition), and Cauchy/Toeplitz connections. This provides the theoretical foundation for proposals 013, 021, 023.

- **Permutation Learning**: 7+ tricks for differentiable permutation optimization — Sinkhorn relaxation, Gumbel-Softmax, OT4P orthogonal relaxation, ShuffleSoftSort, auction algorithm, STE-based learning (STEAM), bipartite matching. Critical infrastructure for proposals involving learned channel permutations (010, 024).

- **GPU Kernel Optimization**: FlashInfer JIT fusion, persistent megakernel fusion, warp specialization, Stream-K GEMM, CTA tile swizzling, horizontal fusion, FlashFuser DSM. These represent the implementation toolkit for making any winning architecture *actually fast*.

- **Tropical & Alternative Semirings**: Tropical attention via Hilbert projective metric, SIMD² semiring matrix acceleration, semiring monoid lifting. Foundation for proposals 014 and 015.

- **Sparsity Acceleration**: 2:4 structured sparsity, V:N:M hierarchical sparsity, transposable N:M masks, S-STE continuous pruning, PA-DST permutation-augmented sparsity. Foundation for proposals 010 and 024.

### Strategic Insights

**The displacement-rank failure (Exp 004) is highly informative.** It shows that elegant structured matrix parameterizations can have fatal optimization barriers — the Cauchy kernel 1/(s_i - s_j) creates ill-conditioned gradients that prevent learning even when the capacity is sufficient. **This should raise caution for Proposal 003 (DPLR Column-Sparse)**, which uses the same Cauchy machinery. Proposals that rely on FFT-based diagonalization (013, 023) or simple element-wise operations (009, 015) are structurally safer for optimization.

**The OscGate-SSM success (Exp 003) validates a key principle**: stability-by-construction + input-dependent gating is achievable simultaneously. This opens the door to Proposal 020 (Oscillatory Householder DeltaProduct) as a natural next step, and confirms that the oscillatory parameterization is viable when properly implemented (unlike Exp 002's buggy forward pass).

**Recommended priority ordering for next experiments** (all under $1):
1. **Proposal 009** (Post-Sigmoid Gating) — $0.50, highest ratio of potential insight to effort
2. **Proposal 013** (Circulant SSM) — $0.25, cleanest mathematical test
3. **Proposal 015** (Tropical-Gated SSM) — $0.25, tests a radically different semiring
4. **Proposal 006** (Monarch-Gated SSM) — $0.50, validates the leading structured transition approach
5. **Fix Experiment 002** — $0.00, unblock the oscillatory-DPLR line before proposing further compositions

The emerging theme is a **two-track research strategy**: (a) *readout improvements* (009) that compose with anything, and (b) *structured transition exploration* (013, 006, 015) seeking the right point on the expressivity-parallelism tradeoff. Track (a) is low-risk and should run immediately; track (b) should prioritize proposals with the simplest optimization landscapes (circulant > Monarch > Cauchy).
