### 🎯 High-Impact Proposals

**1. Post-Sigmoid Gating for Linear Attention / SSM Readout** (Proposal 009) — Priority: **HIGH**
- **Hypothesis**: Applying post-readout sigmoid gating (NeurIPS 2025 Best Paper technique) to linear attention and SSM outputs will break their low-rank bottleneck, with *larger* gains than for softmax attention since these models suffer worse information compression.
- **Why it matters**: This is the lowest-hanging fruit in the entire proposal set. It's a **2-line code change** (add `sigmoid(W_g @ x) ⊙ output` after readout) that applies a proven technique to a new domain. The insight that linear attention/SSMs have a *more severe* W_V·W_O low-rank bottleneck than softmax attention is non-obvious and well-reasoned. If it works, it's an instant quality boost to every GLA/Mamba-2/cosFormer variant.
- **Estimated cost**: **<$1** (MVE: 2-layer cosFormer ± gate on MQAR, ~80K params, 10 min on CPU)
- **Impact score**: **9/10** — Near-zero implementation cost, proven mechanism, broad applicability. Only risk is that it doesn't help as much as hypothesized.

**2. Circulant SSM: Fourier-Domain Parallel Scan** (Proposal 013) — Priority: **HIGH**
- **Hypothesis**: Block-circulant state transitions diagonalize via FFT into the Fourier domain, enabling element-wise parallel scans in frequency space — recovering O(log T) parallel depth of diagonal SSMs with full coordinate-mixing expressivity at O(n log n) cost.
- **Why it matters**: This elegantly resolves the fundamental SSM tension (diagonal = fast but no mixing; dense = expressive but O(n³) scan). The FFT diagonalization is exact (not approximate), and the resulting scan is identical to Mamba's diagonal scan but over n frequency channels. The cyclic group Z_8 composition task is a perfect first test — if circulant SSMs can't track cyclic groups, they're useless.
- **Estimated cost**: **<$2** (MVE: 2-layer model on Z_8 composition, ~5 min GPU)
- **Impact score**: **8/10** — Elegant theory, cheap test, but limited to cyclic mixing patterns (non-abelian groups need more).

### 🧪 Experiment Updates

- **Experiment 002: Oscillatory-DPLR SSM** (Status: ❌ COMPLETED — FAILED)
  - **Proposal**: 004-oscillatory-dplr-ssm
  - **Progress**: Implemented tiny Osc-DPLR (1 layer, n=16, r=2, ~129 params) for damped oscillation extrapolation.
  - **Key findings**: Training MSE 0.854 (target <1e-3), extrapolation MSE 0.759 (target <1e-2). Model completely failed to fit basic oscillations. Likely too small or poorly initialized.
  - **Cost**: $0.00 (CPU only, 27 min)
  - **Verdict**: FAIL, but possibly rescuable with larger model / better hyperparameters. The architecture concept isn't invalidated.

- **Experiment 003: Oscillatory-Gated Selective SSM** (Status: ✅ COMPLETED — PROCEED)
  - **Proposal**: 007-oscillatory-gated-selective-ssm
  - **Progress**: Tested OscGate-SSM vs LinOSS (LTI) vs DiagonalSSM on selective copying. Required 3 iterations to get task design right.
  - **Key findings**: **OscGate-SSM 93.0%** vs LinOSS 46.8% vs DiagonalSSM 94.8%. The 46pp gap between OscGate and LinOSS conclusively proves input-dependent oscillatory parameters enable selectivity. Zero NaN/Inf events — stability-by-construction validated. Speed overhead only 1.80×.
  - **Cost**: $0.00 (CPU only, 25 min)
  - **Verdict**: PROCEED. Core hypothesis validated. Input-dependent ω(x_t), ζ(x_t) work.

- **Experiment 004: Displacement-Rank SSM** (Status: ❌ COMPLETED — ABANDONED)
  - **Proposal**: 022-displacement-rank-ssm-state-transitions
  - **Progress**: Tested Cauchy-like transitions at α ∈ {0,1,2,4,16} on S5 permutation composition.
  - **Key findings**: **Kill criterion triggered.** α=4 did NOT outperform α=1 (both 95.8% on easy task, both <4% on hard task). Dense SSM solved it trivially at 97.2%. Root cause: the 1/(s_i - s_j) Cauchy kernel creates pathological gradients. Without normalization → NaN. With normalization → generators collapse to zero. **Theoretical expressivity ≠ practical learnability.**
  - **Cost**: $0.00 (CPU only, 15 min)
  - **Verdict**: ABANDON. Don't pursue Cauchy-like SSMs at small n.

- **Experiment 008: Cyclic Reduction vs Prefix Scan** (Status: ✅ COMPLETED — PROCEED)
  - **Proposal**: 026-cyclic-reduction-randmscan-ssm-recurrence
  - **Progress**: Pure kernel benchmark comparing CR vs prefix scan for dense SSM recurrence h_t = A_t h_{t-1} + b_t.
  - **Key findings**: **CR achieves 3.88× wall-clock speedup** over prefix scan at T=1024, n=32. GEMM savings of 6× (theoretical: (2/3)·log₂T ≈ 6.7×). Numerically exact to machine precision (8.48e-16). Speedup scales monotonically with T. Initial naive implementation showed NO speedup — vectorizing back-substitution was essential.
  - **Cost**: $0.00 (CPU only, 3 min)
  - **Verdict**: PROCEED. CR is the right parallelization for non-diagonal SSMs.

- **Experiment 006: Tropical-Gated SSM** (Status: 🔄 IMPLEMENTED, awaiting run)
  - **Proposal**: 015-tropical-gated-ssm-scan
  - Tests max-plus semiring recurrence with log-semiring annealing on MQAR.

- **Experiment 007: OH-DeltaProduct** (Status: 🔄 IMPLEMENTED, awaiting run)
  - **Proposal**: 020-oscillatory-householder-deltaproduct
  - Tests oscillatory + Householder decomposition on S3 permutation composition.

- **Experiments 001, 005**: Implemented but details not yet logged.

### 📚 New Discoveries (153 tricks documented)

This was a massive documentation push covering the full spectrum from algebraic foundations to GPU kernel engineering. Key clusters:

- **Circulant/Toeplitz decompositions** (028, 032, 084, 129, 016, 100, 067): A comprehensive toolkit for FFT-based structured matrix computation. The circulant cycle decomposition (028) — any matrix = sum of n circulant components — is particularly powerful as a theoretical foundation for circulant SSMs.

- **HSS/Semiseparable hierarchy** (060, 097, 098, 008, 054, 059, 063, 088, 122, 123, 127, 131, 138, 146): Deep dive into hierarchical low-rank formats. The quasi-optimal greedy HSS approximation (097) and black-box randomized compression (008) are key enablers for the HSS-based linear attention proposals.

- **GPU kernel fusion & scheduling** (033, 039, 046, 047, 049, 051, 061, 075, 091, 103, 121, 135, 141): Production-grade kernel optimization techniques. Warp-specialized pipelining (141, from FlashAttention-3) and persistent megakernel fusion (091, from FlashMoE) are the current state-of-the-art patterns.

- **Permutation learning & N:M sparsity** (003, 007, 017, 058, 070, 085, 087, 089, 110, 114, 115, 116, 130, 133, 140): Everything needed to implement learnable permutations for structured sparsity, from Sinkhorn relaxation to auction algorithms to Gumbel-Softmax.

- **Tropical/semiring algebra** (108, 113, 132): The tropical attention paper (132) and SIMD² semiring acceleration (113) open the door to non-standard algebraic attention mechanisms that can leverage hardware.

### Other Proposals (by estimated cost and impact)

**Cheap & promising (<$2):**
- **Log-Semiring SSM** (014): Softmax-native parallel scan via logsumexp. Elegant but untested whether logsumexp associativity holds numerically at scale. ~$0.40 MVE.
- **Tropical-Gated SSM** (015): Already implemented as Exp 006. Max-plus winner-take-all dynamics. ~$0.50 MVE.
- **Cayley-Circulant Orthogonal SSM** (027): Exact orthogonality via Cayley transform of skew-circulant. Testing as Exp 006b. ~$0.17 MVE.
- **Column-Sparse Negative-Eigenvalue DeltaNet** (001): Combines two proven tricks. ~$0.50 MVE.
- **Monarch-Gated State Transition** (006): BMM-friendly non-diagonal transitions. ~$0.50 MVE.

**Moderate cost ($2-$10):**
- **SSD-DeltaNet** (002): Semiseparable reformulation of DeltaNet for tensor cores. High engineering effort but algebraically exact. ~$5 MVE.
- **Circulant-Diagonal SSM** (023): CD products for O(n log n) state transitions. ~$2 MVE.
- **Neumann-Cayley Orthogonal SSM** (028): Approximate Cayley via Neumann series for input-dependent orthogonal transitions. ~$3 MVE.
- **Chimera-Fused Chunkwise SSM** (032): GEMM-chain fusion for intra-chunk computation. Kernel engineering heavy. ~$5 MVE.

**Expensive (>$10) — deprioritize:**
- **V:N:M Sparse SSM Projections** (031): Needs A100/H100 for Sparse Tensor Core evaluation.
- **Expert-Choice Monarch SSM** (012): Multi-head MoE-style routing, requires scale for meaningful results.
- **Group-Matrix Displacement Rank SSM** (030): Theoretically deep but complex implementation.
- **Nyström Landmark Chunkwise SSM** (025): Interesting compression but unclear practical benefit.

### Strategic Insights

**Three themes dominate this research burst:**

1. **"Simple parameterizations beat elegant ones"** — Experiment 004's failure is the loudest signal. The Cauchy-like displacement rank framework is mathematically beautiful but practically untrained. Meanwhile, trivially parameterized dense or diagonal+low-rank SSMs work. This should bias proposal selection toward **mechanically simple** ideas (post-sigmoid gating, circulant FFT diagonalization) over algebraically sophisticated ones (group-matrix displacement, hyperoctahedral FFTs).

2. **Cyclic reduction is a validated win** — Experiment 008 proved 3.88× speedup for non-diagonal SSM scans. This immediately de-risks every proposal that relies on non-diagonal state transitions (Monarch, circulant, Householder products). The researcher should **integrate CR into the next SSM experiment** rather than treating it as standalone infrastructure.

3. **The "selectivity + stability" combination works** — Experiment 003 confirmed that input-dependent oscillatory parameters achieve selectivity (93%) with zero NaN events. Combined with the Exp 004 lesson that optimization matters more than expressivity, the **immediate priority should be Proposal 009 (post-sigmoid gating)** — it's the cheapest test of a proven mechanism applied to the models we already know work.

**Recommended next 3 experiments (in order):**
1. **Proposal 009** — Post-sigmoid gating on linear attention (~$0.50, 10 min)
2. **Run Experiment 006** — Tropical-Gated SSM (already implemented)
3. **Proposal 013** — Circulant SSM on Z_8 cyclic group (~$2, 5 min)
